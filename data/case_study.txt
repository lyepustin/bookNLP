These  microservices - for instance, the UserManagement service, are packaged as Docker containers and run on a Kubernetes cluster. BookMyEvent operations team uses a GitOps approach to build, test and rollout new versions of those microservices. A high level  overview of the existing architecture is displayed below:Mobile and desktop browsers can access the storefront at www.bookmyevent.com. The backend services - running on Kubernetes - are served via an API Gateway. The UserManagement microservice is written in Python and responsible for users lifecycle and  authenticating. The User DB contains BookMyEvent customer data. The Inventory microservice is written in Go and responsible for  the purchasing process. The Inventory DB not only contains BookMyEvent products, but also the purchase history.There are clickstream event from the frontend, which is used for tracking user activity for the further analytics. Those are gathered  via Snowplow in Kafka.As for the external marketing sources: Google, Facebook, Tiktok, Twitter Ads.

Your JobThe current analytics in this company are built on Excel sheets. They would like to have an analytical tool that would allow them to  have a reporting system, A/B testing, ad-hoc research and possibly ML models.Your job is to propose a data platform solution on any cloud which can help BookMyEvent Inc better understand their business and  make data-driven decisions.

There is a list of soft requirements that you can consider when implementing the solution: 1)Data sources might be huge, so that would be great if the solution can be ef ficient and scalable. 2)Would be nice if the data that used for the reporting were as consistent as possible. 3)Since most tables in the DBs are not append-only , analysts may want to have their historical changes. Would be great if a solution could help them with this.

DeliverablesBookMyEvent expects a 30 minutes presentation where you use a slide deck to explain the solution architecture, motivate design  choices, explain how you tackled the 3 main requirements as well as answer questions from the BookMyEvent team. 

Final RemarksAssumptions If something is vague or unclear in the description above, make reasonable assumptions. Y ou need to document  those assumptions and be prepared to explain and defend them.Presentation You need to bring your own laptop to present the solution architecture. It can be slides only , no implementation  necessary. You can use the of ficial cloud icons to create an architecture diagram for your presentation.


Resume:
    BookMyEvent Inc is an online event planning and management company that wants to improve its analytics capabilities. 
    BookMyEvent Inc currently utilizes multiple microservices written in Python and Golang. These microservices, such as the UserManagement service, are packaged as Docker containers and run on a Kubernetes cluster. The backend services are served via an API Gateway, and the UserManagement microservice handles user lifecycle and authentication using Python. The Inventory microservice, written in Go, manages the purchasing process, and the Inventory DB stores both product information and purchase history. The company also collects clickstream events from the frontend using Snowplow in Kafka. In terms of external marketing sources, BookMyEvent utilizes Google, Facebook, Tiktok, and Twitter Ads.
    BookMyEvent Inc is seeking a data platform solution to enhance their analytics capabilities. The solution should be implemented on a cloud platform and enable reporting, A/B testing, ad-hoc research, and potentially machine learning models. It should also be efficient and scalable to handle large data sources. Consistency of data used for reporting is important, and the solution should provide historical changes for non-append tables. 
    The deliverables include a 30-minute presentation explaining the solution architecture, design choices, and how the soft requirements were addressed. 
    Assumptions should be documented, an architecture diagram using official cloud icons is recommended.
